# No Devtools?

If you're on Andoid you will not be able to open devtools... <br/>
ofc I've thought about that and made a tool in the ``` Android/ ``` <br/>
Directory so you can extract the cookie from the url ecosia sent you per mail

Example:

``` https://www.ecosia.com/account/verify?token=... ```

# Note

You're Account can be banned!!!

# FARM TREEEEEEEEES
